               <b>CRYSTAL</b> 
                How do I make Crystal believe her mind is more powerful than how she perceived it to be? <p>
            How do I make her see beyond this vague imagination that has built its way too big a cloud for her to predict when the sun sets or rises. <p>

            Clearly she has reached the limit when default reset is no longer a button you find on display.
            How do I find those set of words that says the right thing at the same time delivers swift comprehensible changes to how Crystal feels.
            How do I  convinced that kind-hearted being that friendship and genuine intimacy could be so beautiful and changes everything she holds dear and it brings out the very best in her. But those words………….something about those words- She’s heard those words more times for her to lose the meaning of each letter contained in each word of the sentence. 
            You see, Crystal is no ordinary girl neither is she extra-ordinary. She’s is just….just more from the end of ordinary and a little bit less extraordinary. She’s neither the kind that prods nor nags or complains about little thing she cannot control. She’s so jovial and spontaneous to situations where need be. I’ve seen her make mighty men tremble with how little they imagined their heart could love as big as their body could have them and I’ve seen her make little boys grow with confidence to make themselves real men.
            Things Crystal did. 
            Then a day came when those men from their perverse theology decided she has out-lived her usefulness and value. How they threw her out to the streets. How they let the world see how cheap she could be. Bruises and scars was all I could see from the harsh blows she’d received with men taking turns in hitting her. What a demeaning scene it was, being in such an atmosphere and witnessing the most humiliating outburst from such a crowd was like a bad dream.
                How she cried and screamed from pains being inflicted on her in the most primitive manner ever thought upon.
            The shame and mortification she felt as she slowly gathered her belongings- her phone has now been literally torn to pieces, how ripped her jeans has now turned to. That feeling she felt as she hurriedly searched for her pairs of shoes and wondering if she would ever find her purse together with all her vital information it entails and what a mess her hair would have turned out to be at this point.
            After a long deep breath, she took that very first step.
             But where did it all go wrong? How could a whole crowd be gunning against a creature that appeared so innocent and harmless? What warranted that very scene on that very fateful day? What might be going on in the minds of her attackers?
            Those same questions has left her paralyzed and perplexed for countless years. Why would people treat such a damsel with hate after being first loved like every day was the first day.
            Funny how those little sweet-talks and laughs now fades as the day passes and it becomes too deafening to them just because they’ve either outgrown her or found a better Mary –or  so they said. Because… 
            That’s how They treated Crystal.
            That’s how You treated Crystal.
            That’s how you treated LOVE!!!
